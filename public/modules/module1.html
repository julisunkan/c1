        <h2>What is Cybersecurity?</h2>
        <p>
            Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. 
            These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; 
            extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Key Definition:</strong> Cybersecurity encompasses technologies, processes, and controls designed 
            to protect systems, networks, programs, devices, and data from cyber attacks.
        </div>

        <h2>The CIA Triad</h2>
        <p>The foundation of information security is built on three core principles known as the CIA triad:</p>

        <h3>1. Confidentiality</h3>
        <p>
            Ensures that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access. 
            This involves protecting data from unauthorized disclosure.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encryption of sensitive data</li>
            <li>Access controls and authentication</li>
            <li>Data classification policies</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Integrity</h3>
        <p>
            Maintains the accuracy and completeness of data. It ensures that information 
            has not been altered in an unauthorized manner.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Digital signatures and checksums</li>
            <li>Version control systems</li>
            <li>Data validation mechanisms</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Availability</h3>
        <p>
            Ensures that information and resources are available to authorized users when needed. 
            This includes maintaining system uptime and preventing service disruptions.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Redundancy and failover systems</li>
            <li>Regular backups</li>
            <li>Disaster recovery planning</li>
        </ul>

            <li><strong>Worms:</strong> Standalone malware that spreads across networks</li>
            <li><strong>Trojans:</strong> Disguised malware that appears legitimate</li>
            <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Encrypts files and demands payment for decryption</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Social Engineering</h3>
        <p>Psychological manipulation of people to perform actions or divulge confidential information.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Phishing emails</li>
            <li>Pretexting (creating false scenarios)</li>
            <li>Baiting (offering something enticing)</li>
            <li>Tailgating (following authorized personnel)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Network Attacks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>DDoS:</strong> Distributed Denial of Service attacks</li>
