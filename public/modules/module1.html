<h1>Getting Started with Penetration Testing</h1>

<h2>What is Penetration Testing?</h2>
<p>Penetration testing, often called "pen testing," is a simulated cyber attack against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. In the context of web application security, the process involves attempting to breach any number of application systems (e.g., application protocol interfaces (APIs), frontend/backend servers) to uncover vulnerabilities, such as unsanitized inputs that are susceptible to code injection attacks.</p>

<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of this comprehensive penetration testing course, you will have achieved the following learning objectives:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Understand the fundamentals of ethical hacking</strong> - Learn the core principles, methodologies, and legal frameworks</li>
    <li><strong>Master essential tools and techniques</strong> - Gain proficiency with industry-standard tools like Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, and more</li>
    <li><strong>Develop hands-on practical skills</strong> - Practice on real-world scenarios using vulnerable applications and environments</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare for certification exams</strong> - Build knowledge and skills required for OSCP, CEH, and other security certifications</li>
    <li><strong>Build a professional portfolio</strong> - Document your findings and create professional penetration testing reports</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ethics in Penetration Testing</h2>
<p>Ethical hacking is the cornerstone of legitimate penetration testing. As a penetration tester, you must always operate within legal and ethical boundaries:</p>

    <h4>The Penetration Tester's Code of Ethics</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authorization First:</strong> Never test systems without explicit written permission</li>
        <li><strong>Scope Respect:</strong> Stay within the defined boundaries of your testing engagement</li>
        <li><strong>Data Protection:</strong> Respect privacy and confidentiality of client data</li>
        <li><strong>Responsible Disclosure:</strong> Report vulnerabilities responsibly to the appropriate parties</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> Stay updated with the latest security threats and defense mechanisms</li>
    </ul>
